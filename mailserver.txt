Short answer: Yes, but not in the same health endpoint.
Adding mail server health to microservices health can be a good approach only if done correctly.Below is a production-grade recommendation, especially relevant for Spring Boot microservices like yours. Bad approach (common mistake)Adding mail server (SMTP) checks directly to:/actuator/healthWhy this is riskyMail server may be temporarily slow / downYour service itself may still be perfectly healthyKubernetes / ALB may:Restart podsRemove instances from trafficCreates false negatives Result: unnecessary restarts & instability Recommended approach (best practice) Split health into Liveness and ReadinessHealth TypePurposeShould include mail server?LivenessIs app running? NOReadinessCan app serve requests? Usually NOExternal dependency healthObservability YES (separately) Ideal Health Design /actuator/health/livenessInclude only:JVM aliveThread deadlockBasic internal checksNO external systems /actuator/health/readinessInclude only critical dependencies that block request handling:DatabaseRedis / CacheMessage broker (if synchronous)Mail server usually NOT critical for readinessWhy?Email is often asyncApp can still process requests even if email fails /actuator/health/mail (Custom) Best place for mail server healthPurpose:MonitoringAlertingDebuggingOps visibilityNot used by:Kubernetes probesLoad balancer health checks Spring Boot – Correct Implementation Custom Mail Health Indicator@Component("mail")public class MailHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator { @Override public Health health() { try { // Try SMTP connection / ping return Health.up() .withDetail("smtp", "reachable") .build(); } catch (Exception e) { return Health.down() .withDetail("smtp", "not reachable") .withException(e) .build(); } }} Expose selectivelymanagement: endpoints: web: exposure: include: health endpoint: health: group: liveness: include: livenessState readiness: include: db, redisMail health is available at:/actuator/health/mail Kubernetes Perspective (Very Important)CheckShould mail server be included?Liveness Probe NEVERReadiness Probe Almost neverMonitoring (Prometheus / Dynatrace) YESAlerts (Ops team) YES When DOES it make sense to include mail in readiness?Only if:Email sending is synchronousRequest must fail if mail failsExample:OTP via emailPassword reset email (blocking)Even then:
 Better handled as application-level error, not pod health. Final Recommendation (Production) Best practice Do NOT put mail server health in global /health Do NOT affect pod readiness Add separate mail health indicator Monitor via Dynatrace / Prometheus Alert ops, don’t restart podsIf you want, I can also:Design health groups for your EKS setupShow Dynatrace / OpenTelemetry integrationSuggest timeouts & circuit breaker patterns for mailJust tell me
